# BM WP Experience

On a typical WordPress setup there are many small tweaks that we do all the time. Helping with workflow, security or performance.

We call this our WordPress Experience because it's an opinionated set of features that make sense for a majority of our builds. Whether they are on
the [Company Cloud platform](https://companycloud.io) or an install with any theme or plugins. It's simply the way we like WordPress.

For almost every feature there is a filter, constant or action allowing you to customize the behavior.

## Setting up Monitoring

To set up monitoring via [OhDear.app](https://ohdear.app) you need to add the REST API endpoint to the website in OhDear's application monitoring settings. The URL
is `https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/bm-wp-experience/v1/application-health`.

To run this endpoint, a secret must be configured and defined in your config:

```php
define( 'BM_WP_OH_DEAR_SECRET', 'my-secret-here' );
```

The same secret needs to be defined in OhDear's settings. It will then be sent via all requests to the API. The secrets in OhDear and the application must match for proper
authentication.
